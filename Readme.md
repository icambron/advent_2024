My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) solutions for 2024.

# Goals

Just having fun. Not competitive on any metric. Aiming for:

1. Correct
2. Elegant and idiomatic
3. Reasonably performant

# Running

You'll need _all_ the input files or it won't even compile. Get your own from the AoC site.

```
# Run the given day
cargo run -- -d <day>

# Run the given day with sample input
cargo run -- -d <day> -s

# Run all days
cargo run -- -a
```

There's a `-c` arg that checks the outputs, but it'll only work with my inputs.
